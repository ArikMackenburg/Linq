## The Problem Domain
Create a program that brings in data from an external file, reads the data, and can filter the data based on specified values.

### Program Specifications
Your solution should include the following:

+ The data.json file to your solution root folder
+ Read in the file and answer the questions below
+ Each question and answer should be outputted to the console.
##### Questions
Each query builds off of the prior query. You should be chaining.

+ Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list (Final Total: 147 neighborhoods)
+ Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names (Final Total: 143)
+ Remove the duplicates (Final Total: 39 neighborhoods)
+ Rewrite the queries from above and consolidate all into one single query.
+ Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ Query statements instead of LINQ method calls and vice versa.)
You should have a total of 5 outputs.

### Guidance
Provided is a JSON file that contains a data set of location information for properties in Manhattan.

+ Use LINQ queries and Lambda statements (when appropriate) to find the answers.
+ Use a combination of both to answer the questions.
+ Explore the NuGet packages and install NewtonSoftJson
+ Do some self research and find out how to read in JSON file (hint: JsonConvert.DeserializedOject is part of it)
+ You will need to break up each section of the JSON file up into different classes, use your resources - ask the TAâ€™s if your stuck. (Maybe find a converter of some sort??)
### Unit Tests
Test that your program has the following functionality:

+ No tests are required for this lab.
